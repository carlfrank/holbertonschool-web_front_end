The skeleton of an HTML5 page includes:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Page content goes here -->
</body>
</html>

How to use semantic HTML tags to structure a web page:

Semantic HTML tags provide meaning to the web page. Examples include <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <nav>, and <aside>. Use them to define the structure and outline of your content.

Which use cases to use div vs span:

Use <div> for block-level elements, which typically start on a new line and take up the full width available.
Use <span> for inline elements, which do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
The semantic value of header, main, footer, article, nav, section, aside:

<header>: Represents introductory content or a group of navigational aids.
<main>: Signifies the main content of the document, unique to that document.
<footer>: Contains information about the container it's within, usually authorship, related documents, and copyright information.
<article>: Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, or site, that is intended to be independently distributable or reusable.
<nav>: Represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigational links.
<section>: Represents a standalone section that doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it.
<aside>: Represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content.
How to use headings (and why itâ€™s important to follow the hierarchical order):

Headings <h1> to <h6> represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> the lowest.
Maintaining the order is important for accessibility, as screen readers use them to navigate content, and for SEO, as search engines use them to understand content structure.
How to make lists in HTML:

Ordered lists <ol> for lists where the order of the items matters.
Unordered lists <ul> for lists where the order does not matter.
List items <li> are used within either type of list to define each item.
The differences between media (SVG, GIF, PNG, JPG):

SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics, a vector image format that scales without losing quality, ideal for logos and icons.
GIF: Supports animation and transparency, limited to 256 colors, best for simple animations.
PNG: Supports millions of colors and transparency, best for complex images requiring transparency.
JPG: Supports millions of colors but no transparency, best for photographs.
